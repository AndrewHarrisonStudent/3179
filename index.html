          <h2>How many people are injured or killed?</h2>
          <p>One of the most important statistics about road accidents
            is that of injuries and fatalities. Ultimately, car crashes are
            unfortunate consequences of a multitude of factors that come with modern 
            infrastructure. Since we aren't getting rid of motorvehicles anytime soon,
            it can prove useful to take a closer look at the factors surrounding these
            accidents, such that appropriate policies and action can be taken to minimise
            the state-wide impact (seen map above) and the unfortunate impact on life 
            (seen right). As shown, more than half the people involved in accidents are
            either injured or killed.

          <h2>Accident Type</h2>
          <p>One aspect we can inspect is that of accident types, which help to indicate
            whether one type of accident is more likely than the other. We can also take 
            a look at the pattern over time, such as days in a week, to spot any consistencies
            that should be addressed. 
            As seen to the left, there is an increased prevelance of car accidents
            during the work days, which slowly increase leading into Friday. The most common
            accident appears to be vehicle on vehicle collisions throughout the week.

          <h2>Road Geometry</h2>
          <p>Road Geometry is an interesting attribute to inspect, due to the focus
            from many Victorian officials in charge of road safety advocating for speed
            cameras at intersections to minimise the risk of accidents. Although we cannot
            draw significant conclusions from this analysis, it is easy to see that more than
            half the road accidents, from 2013-2019, did not occur at an intersection. This result
            may be due to the fact that the speed cameras deter reckless driving at important 
            intersection types, such as 'Cross' and 'T', however, it appears more could be done
            to minimise accidents on regular streets.

          <h2>Alcohol Related</h2>
          <p>Drink-Driving is a known issue, and it may appear that past campaigns have of made a strong impact on 
            minimising it's occurance. Regardless of alcohol, however, more
            accidents occur at school pick-up time (3PM-4PM) and peak-hour traffic times (8:45AM, and 5:30PM), 
            than at any other point in the day.

          <h2>Light Conditions</h2>
          <p>Visibility is the most important factor surround a driver's capabilities to
            operate a motorvehicle. It may appear counterintuitive then, that more accidents
            occur during the day, than at dusk, dawn, or night. This can possibly be explained
            by the higher proportion of cars being present on the road throughout the day, 
            leading to a greater risk of accidents occuring, which is reflected in these 
            figures. Hence, it is easy to see, that although we may have assumptions on what
            factors may appear to be detrimental to drivers, it is only by looking at the data
            we can uncover the true detail.
